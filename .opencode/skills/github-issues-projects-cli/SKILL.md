# GitHub Issues And Projects CLI

Use this skill when GitHub Issues and GitHub Projects are the collaboration surface and the main risk is wasting time guessing `gh` commands, GraphQL arguments, or `jq` filters.

This skill is about operational fluency, not just raw command execution. The goal is to make GitHub collaboration changes predictable, inspectable, and reversible before mutating anything important.

Use `github-agentic-delivery-flow` for the overall operating model and `github-conventions` for repository workflow rules. Use this skill for the command-level mechanics.

## Purpose

Use `gh` as the primary interface for GitHub collaboration artifacts:

- issues
- milestones
- labels
- comments
- assignees
- project items
- project fields and status options
- board and backlog reporting

Use `jq` to shape JSON outputs so the user gets the exact answer or exact mutation target without trial-and-error loops.

## Repository Configuration

Repository-specific defaults live in the sole committed project config source:

`./.github-project.env`

```bash
source ./.github-project.env
```

That file stores every config value with the `ANT_TEAM_` prefix (`ANT_TEAM_GITHUB_OWNER`, `ANT_TEAM_GITHUB_PROJECT_NUMBER`, `ANT_TEAM_GITHUB_PROJECT_ID`, `ANT_TEAM_GITHUB_WORKFLOW_STATE_FIELD_ID`, `ANT_TEAM_GITHUB_WORKFLOW_STATE_OPTION_IN_REVIEW_ID`, `ANT_TEAM_WORKTREE_ROOT`, `ANT_TEAM_DOCS_PROJECT_PATH`, and so on), covering:

- owner, repo, owner type
- project number and project ID
- field IDs (including the canonical `Workflow State` field)
- Workflow State option IDs (one `ANT_TEAM_GITHUB_WORKFLOW_STATE_OPTION_<STATE>_ID` per canonical state; `<STATE>` is the canonical name uppercased with spaces and dashes mapped to underscores, e.g. `IN_PROGRESS`, `NEED_ATTENTIONS`)
- the default `ANT_TEAM_WORKTREE_ROOT` and the `ANT_TEAM_DOCS_*` documentation routing exports

Prefer sourcing it over any other config lookup. The env is seeded and updated by project initialization itself (`"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/init-project.sh"` after `scripts/init-company.sh`; there is no standalone generator and no JSON config): existing values are preserved and missing keys are filled. The helper sources this file read-only — it never writes or edits it. The bundled `gh_project_helper.sh` sources the env as its sole local runtime config; `"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh"` is the thin centralized wrapper that invokes it (with `bash`, so mirror execute bits are never required).

The env file is intended to be committed to the repository because it stores shared GitHub collaboration metadata rather than secrets.

Keep the JSON as the structured source of truth because GitHub project metadata often grows into structured mappings such as:

- Workflow State name to option ID
- field name to field ID
- arrays of common workflow states
- repo-level workflow defaults such as top-level `worktreeRoot`

## Common Actions To Support Explicitly

Be concrete when the user asks for any of these common GitHub collaboration actions:

- create an issue comment
- create an issue that represents a task
- create a milestone that represents a spec or deliverable
- find the GitHub Project item ID for an issue
- list issues in a given Workflow State on a project board
- transition an issue to the next Workflow State
- complete an issue
- create a PR when an issue is ready for code review
- comment on a PR
- reply to a PR review comment
- inspect PR checks and CI workflow runs
- create, inspect, or edit a release
- recover the board state of an issue after a failed status mutation
- reconcile a local Obsidian record with GitHub after an offline write

For these actions, prefer returning the exact command sequence rather than only describing the workflow.

## Default Mindset

Start with discovery before mutation.

That usually means:

1. Confirm repository and owner context.
2. Inspect the current issue or project state.
3. Discover the exact field IDs, item IDs, and option IDs needed.
4. Show or summarize the planned mutation when the command is non-obvious.
5. Execute the smallest safe mutation.
6. Re-read the affected resource to verify the result.

Do not guess field names, single-select option IDs, or project item IDs.

## Command Strategy

Prefer commands in this order:

1. the bundled helper for issue, milestone, PR/review, CI/testing, release, board/project query, and dual-record sync operations (`issue-create`, `issue-view`, `issue-list`, `issue-edit`, `issue-comment`, `issue-close`, `milestone-create`, `milestone-list`, `milestone-edit`, `milestone-close`, `pr-create`, `pr-view`, `pr-list`, `pr-comment`, `pr-close`, `pr-merge`, `pr-checks`, `pr-review-reply`, `run-list`, `run-view`, `workflow-list`, `workflow-run`, `release-create`, `release-list`, `release-view`, `release-edit`, `release-delete`, `issue-sync`, `milestone-sync`, plus the board/project query family: `item-id`, `item-state`, `item-get`, `list-statuses`, `list-items`, `list-unassigned`, `project-list`, `project-view`, `project-field-list`, `set-status`, `set-status-id`, `next-status`, `add-issue`, `gh-item-edit`) — thin wrappers around the matching `gh` subcommands and `gh api` that resolve the target repository and board from `.github-project.env` so no `--repo` or owner has to be repeated
2. `gh issue ...` directly when operating outside a repository with `.github-project.env`
3. raw `gh project ...` only for board operations the helper does not cover (every board read the workflow uses — items, statuses, fields, project metadata — has a helper subcommand)
4. `gh api graphql` when GitHub Projects v2 mutations or richer joins are needed
5. `jq` to extract only the fields needed for the next step

Prefer structured output over human-formatted output:

- use `--json`
- use `--jq` for simple extraction
- use external `jq` for more involved transforms
- the helper's `issue-view` and `issue-list` print curated collaboration JSON by default; pass `--json`, `--jq`, `--template`, `--comments`, or `--web` to control the shape yourself (all other flags pass straight through to `gh issue`)
- for repeated GitHub Project operations, prefer the centralized wrapper `"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh"` (it routes to this skill's bundled engine and saves tokens by avoiding re-derived GraphQL details)
- prefer repo-local defaults (source `./.github-project.env` — the sole committed project config source — for `ANT_TEAM_*` values) before asking the user again for owner or project number
- prefer repo-local IDs from the sourced env before calling GitHub endpoints to rediscover stable field IDs and option IDs

## Required Behavior

- Resolve repo context before acting. Use explicit `--repo owner/name` when ambiguity is possible.
- Read before writing. Inspect the current issue, project, item, or field state first.
- When working with a project, discover the project ID, item ID, field ID, and option ID instead of assuming them.
- Remember that a GitHub issue ID and a GitHub Project item ID are different identifiers. Status updates on the project board require the project item ID, not the issue number alone.
- Prefer listing and filtering JSON once over repeated trial commands.
- If a command mutates GitHub state, re-read the resource afterward and report the changed state.
- If the user asks for a bulk change, preview the candidate targets first unless they explicitly want direct execution.
- Keep comments and updates concise, durable, and collaboration-friendly.

## Standard Workflows

### 1. Issue Triage

Use this flow when the user wants to inspect or update one or more issues:

1. Identify repo context.
2. Query the issue set with the helper (`issue-list`, `issue-view`) or raw `gh issue list` / `gh issue view` outside a configured repo.
3. Shape the output to show number, title, state, labels, assignees, milestone, and URL.
4. If mutating, run the smallest issue edit command possible (`issue-edit`, `issue-comment`, `issue-close`).
5. Re-read the issue to verify labels, assignees, milestone, or state.

Common operations:

- list open issues by label, assignee, or milestone
- open an issue
- add labels
- set assignee
- attach milestone
- comment with final decisions, status, closure, or review outcomes
- close or reopen issues

### 2. Project Board Inspection

Use this flow when the user wants to understand a GitHub Project board:

1. Identify owner type and owner login.
2. List projects with the helper (`project-list [--owner OWNER]`) and confirm the correct project number.
3. Read the project and its fields with the helper (`project-view N`, `project-field-list N`).
4. List board items with the helper (`list-items`, optionally filtered by a canonical Workflow State; `list-unassigned` for unassigned work).
5. Shape the output with `jq` only when the curated helper output needs further summarizing.
6. When a mutation targets a specific issue on the board, resolve the project item ID from the issue number (`item-id`) before editing status fields.

Do not jump straight to mutation until the board schema is known.

### 3. Project Item State Change

Use this flow when the user wants to move issues across board states:

1. Find the project.
2. Find the project item for the issue.
3. Read the field schema and locate the canonical `Workflow State` field.
4. Find the option ID for the target state.
5. Execute the mutation.
6. Re-read the item or project listing to confirm the new state.

This matters because GitHub Projects v2 updates often require opaque IDs rather than human-readable names.

### 4. Backlog Or Status Reporting

Use this flow when the user wants summaries or filtered views:

1. Pull JSON from issues or project items.
2. Use `jq` to group or filter by milestone, label, assignee, or status.
3. Return a compact table or bullet summary rather than dumping raw JSON.

Good examples:

- issues by milestone
- blocked items on the board
- items in review with no assignee
- tasks missing milestones
- open issues not on the project board

## Command-First Playbook

When the user asks for a common action, start from these defaults and adapt them to the repo and project context.

### Create Comment On An Issue

Use:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" issue-comment ISSUE_NUMBER \
  --body "Final decision: approved with the follow-up filed as #51."
```

Comments carry only final decisions, status, closure, and code-review outcomes; durable handoffs and reasoning live in the central Obsidian project folder. Pass `--body-file` for longer notes.

### Create Issue As A Task

Use:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" issue-create "TASK: short task title" \
  --body-file /tmp/issue.md \
  --label type:feature \
  --assignee USERNAME \
  --milestone "SPEC-001"
```

The first positional is the required title; every other flag passes straight through to `gh issue create`. Prefer `--body-file` when the task template is more than a couple of lines. The command is local-first (see the dual-record section) and prints the curated `{"number", "title", "state", "url"}` result derived from the creation response.

### Create Milestone As A Spec

Use:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" milestone-create "SPEC-001: Deliverable name" \
  "Short summary with spec link and owner"
```

The description is optional. The helper wraps the REST milestones API via `gh api` (there is no dedicated `gh milestone create` command) and prints a curated summary (number, title, state, counts, URL). Related commands:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" milestone-list            # open milestones
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" milestone-list all
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" milestone-edit MILESTONE_NUMBER -f title="SPEC-001: Revised name"
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" milestone-close MILESTONE_NUMBER
```

### Resolve Project Item ID For An Issue

Use:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" item-id ISSUE_NUMBER
```

Assume issue-to-project linking is usually automatic in this repository workflow. Do not manually link an issue unless the board automation failed or the user explicitly asks for a manual add. The manual-add fallback command is:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" add-issue https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/ISSUE_NUMBER
```

The helper never deletes board items, so it cannot undo an accidental duplicate add — remove the extra item in GitHub; until the board is clean, the ambiguity-safe item resolution above refuses to guess.

Use the project item ID whenever you need to update project status or any project field for that issue. When the issue has no board item, `item-id` exits non-zero with stderr naming the issue number — treat that as a linking failure, not an empty result.

### Curated Board Query Output Contract

The curated board commands do not merely call the underlying CLI — they return useful structured results (locked by `tests/test_gh_project_helper_board_output.js`, `tests/test_gh_project_helper_board_project_queries.js`, and `tests/test_gh_project_helper_hardening.js`):

- `set-status ISSUE_NUMBER "Ready"` and `set-status-id ISSUE_NUMBER OPTION_ID` print exactly `{"issue_number", "title", "state", "url"}` after the edit, where `state` is re-read from the board AFTER the mutation and verified by option id — the printed object is the verification, so an edit that silently failed cannot report a stale state. Both are idempotent: an item already in the requested state (matched by option id) is re-verified with no duplicate mutation, and a post-edit mismatch exits non-zero with the actual board state on stderr
- `list-items [STATE]` prints one object per issue-linked item with exactly `{"item_id", "issue_number", "title", "state", "assignees", "url"}`; `assignees` are real (the helper runs one shared GraphQL project-items engine, because the flattened item-list payload carries no assignees). `list-unassigned` prints the same shape for items with zero assignees
- `item-id ISSUE_NUMBER` prints `{"item_id", "issue_number", "title", "url", "state"}` so the ID lookup doubles as a state check; a not-found issue exits non-zero. Item resolution by issue number is ambiguity-safe: when an issue was added to the board more than once, the lookup fails non-zero naming every duplicate item id instead of acting on an arbitrary one
- `item-state ISSUE_NUMBER` is the read-only recovery command and prints `{"item_id", "issue_number", "title", "state", "url", "canonical_state"}`; a not-found issue exits non-zero
- `item-get PROJECT_ITEM_ID` is the single-node verification read: it fetches ONE board item directly by its project item id (one `node(id:)` GraphQL query, no board-wide paging) and prints the same `{"item_id", "issue_number", "title", "state", "url", "canonical_state"}` contract as `item-state` — use it when you already hold the item id (from `list-items` output or a `gh-item-edit` follow-up). An unknown/deleted id or a non-issue-linked (draft) item exits non-zero naming the item id
- `list-statuses` resolves env-first: canonical Workflow State option IDs pinned in `.github-project.env` print by canonical name with no remote call (canonical states without a pin are noted on stderr); with no pins it falls back to remote `field-list` option names. A result that still resolves to zero statuses exits non-zero with guidance — never a silent empty success

Workflow State semantics in board queries (founder-confirmed 2026-08-23):

- `state` in item-query output is the REMOTE Workflow State option name, preserved and displayed as-is — never translated to the canonical name (until a founder-approved rename lands, a Backlog-state item may legitimately display a legacy remote name)
- `list-items STATE` accepts a canonical state name and filters by option id (`optionId`), resolved with the same env-first resolver as `set-status` — the filter is name-agnostic, so it stays correct under any remote display name; an unknown state exits non-zero with the same guidance as `set-status`
- the shared items engine reads `first: 100` cursor pages and follows `pageInfo` until the board is exhausted (bounded at 10 pages / 1000 items — truncation beyond the bound is warned on stderr, never silent)

Example (founder demo contract):

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" set-status 37 "Ready"
# {"issue_number":37,"title":"SPEC-003-T7: Local-first dual-record sync","state":"Ready","url":"https://github.com/Antpolis/ant-teams/issues/37"}

"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" list-items "In Review"
# {"item_id":"PVTI_...","issue_number":45,"title":"...","state":"In Review","assignees":["chrissim"],"url":"..."}
```

Treat these shapes as a locked contract; parse them directly instead of re-querying the board after a mutation.

### Inspect Project Metadata

Use the thin project metadata wrappers (curated JSON out; the owner resolves `--owner` flag → `ANT_TEAM_GITHUB_OWNER` env → legacy `OWNER` and is never a positional argument — an empty owner fails before any call, because the underlying list command would otherwise silently target the authenticated user):

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" project-list [--owner OWNER]
# [{"number":9,"title":"Ant Teams","url":"https://github.com/orgs/Antpolis/projects/9","public":false,"closed":false,"items_count":25,"fields_count":14}]

"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" project-view PROJECT_NUMBER [--owner OWNER] [--format json]
# {"number":9,"title":"Ant Teams","url":"...","public":false,"closed":false,"items_count":25,"fields_count":14,"owner":"Antpolis"}

"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" project-field-list PROJECT_NUMBER [--owner OWNER] [--format json]
# {"total_count":14,"fields":[{"id":"PVTF_...","name":"Title","type":"ProjectV2Field"},{"id":"PVTSSF_...","name":"Workflow State","type":"ProjectV2SingleSelectField","options":[{"name":"Inbox","id":"eb66d5a6"}]}]}
```

`PROJECT_NUMBER` is a required positional validated numeric before any call, `--format` accepts only `json`, and `options` appears only on single-select fields. These commands never use the GraphQL items engine — the field-list payload already carries single-select options.

### Curated Mutator Output Contract

Every mutating helper command except the two comment commands returns useful structured JSON, never raw `gh` output (founder standard, locked by `tests/test_gh_project_helper_mutator_output.js`):

- `issue-create TITLE` and `pr-create TITLE` print exactly `{"number", "title", "state", "url"}`, reusing the mutation's URL response for the number and url, the caller's title, and the deterministic `OPEN` state — no extra read. (`pr-create` falls back to the raw response with a stderr warning only when the number cannot be parsed from it.)
- `issue-edit N`, `issue-close N`, `pr-close N`, and `pr-merge N` mutate, then re-read the object and print exactly `{"number", "title", "state", "url"}` — the printed state is the post-mutation verification value (`CLOSED` after a close, `MERGED` after a merge lands), so a silently failed mutation cannot report a stale state. Parse the output directly instead of re-querying.
- `release-create TAG` and `release-edit TAG` mutate, then re-read the release and print the same curated shape as `release-view` (name, tagName, targetCommitish, isDraft, isPrerelease, createdAt, publishedAt, author, body, url) — the mutation response is only a URL, which carries none of those summary fields.
- `release-delete TAG` prints `{"tagName", "url", "deleted": true}` — a deleted release cannot be re-read; the successful mutation is the verification.
- `workflow-run ID_OR_NAME` prints `{"workflow", "repo", "status": "dispatched"}` — the dispatch response carries no run id, so no run read is invented; use `run-list` / `run-view` for run-level summaries.
- `issue-comment N` and `pr-comment N` keep their URL permalink output unchanged: the permalink IS the useful result.

Example:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" issue-close 42 --comment "Completed and validated."
# {"number":42,"title":"SPEC-003-followup: curated structured output","state":"CLOSED","url":"https://github.com/Antpolis/ant-teams/issues/42"}

"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" pr-merge 51 --squash
# {"number":51,"title":"SPEC-003-T1: Extend helper with PR subcommands","state":"MERGED","url":"https://github.com/Antpolis/ant-teams/pull/51"}
```

### List Issues In A Workflow State

Use:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" list-items "Ready"
```

The state argument is a CANONICAL state name; the helper resolves it to its option id (env-first, same resolver as `set-status`) and filters by option id, so the filter stays correct even when the remote board still displays a legacy option name for that state. The printed `state` is always the remote option name as-is. An unknown state exits non-zero with guidance. For unassigned work:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" list-unassigned
```

All helper commands are env-only: owner, project number, and repository resolve from `.github-project.env`; there are no positional owner/project arguments (the project metadata family takes an optional `--owner` flag instead). To list repo issues instead of board items:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" issue-list --label blocked --state open
```

All board operations target the canonical `Workflow State` field. Canonical states: `Open`, `Backlog`, `Ready`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, `Ready to Merge`, `Done`, plus exceptions `Need attentions` (founder-only) and `Blocked`. If the remote board still carries a legacy option name (e.g. `Inbox` for `Open`, `Shaping` for `Backlog`), inspect options with `list-statuses` (env-pinned canonical names first; remote `field-list` names when nothing is pinned) and never rename remote options without explicit founder-approved handling. A board whose status field itself still uses a legacy name (e.g. `Status` instead of `Workflow State`) cannot be resolved remotely at all: remote field/option discovery matches the exact field name, so the env-pinned field and option IDs are then the only working path (env-first commands keep working unchanged).

### Transition Issue To Next Status On Project Board

Use a three-step flow:

1. discover the project item ID for the issue
2. discover the Workflow State field ID and target option ID
3. update the item with GraphQL

Do not skip the discovery steps. GitHub Projects v2 status changes depend on opaque IDs.

Preferred shortcut:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" set-status ISSUE_NUMBER "In Review"
```

The helper resolves the Workflow State field and option IDs from `.github-project.env` (its sole local runtime config), then from the remote board by exact option name. It never creates or renames remote options; if a canonical name has no matching remote option, it fails with guidance instead of mutating the board. When stable IDs are already stored in `.github-project.env`, prefer `gh project item-edit` over raw GraphQL because it uses fewer tokens and matches the installed CLI behavior better.

Important:

- board and project reads go through the helper's query subcommands (`list-items`, `list-unassigned`, `item-id`, `item-state`, `item-get`, `list-statuses`, `project-list`, `project-view`, `project-field-list`) — they already join assignees and Workflow State option ids, and every item read/lookup follows cursor pagination through the shared engine
- the underlying item-edit mutation does not accept `--owner` and requires `--project-id`; the helper's `set-status`/`set-status-id` resolve both from `.github-project.env`
- `set-status`, `set-status-id`, and `next-status` accept an optional trailing `[owner_type]` positional — `org` (default) or `user` for personal-projects boards; when omitted it resolves from `ANT_TEAM_GITHUB_OWNER_TYPE`
- `next-status ISSUE_NUMBER CURRENT NEXT` is the guarded transition: it first verifies (by option id, so a legacy remote display name cannot fool it) that the item currently sits in CURRENT; if the precondition fails it exits non-zero with the actual board state and performs no mutation

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" next-status ISSUE_NUMBER "Ready" "In Progress"
```

- board read calls retry transient failures (rate limit, network) a bounded number of times and then exit 3 — safe to retry later. Mutations are never retried: a failed item-edit fails the command immediately.

If the user hits `unknown flag: --owner`, switch immediately to `gh project item-edit --project-id ...`.

For direct low-level editing with pre-resolved IDs, use:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" gh-item-edit ITEM_ID STATUS_FIELD_ID STATUS_OPTION_IN_REVIEW_ID
```

### Recover Board State After A Failed Status Mutation

When a status mutation fails, exits non-zero on a verification mismatch, or is interrupted, do NOT blind-retry with guessed arguments. Recover with the read-only `item-state` command first:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" item-state ISSUE_NUMBER
# {"item_id":"PVTI_...","issue_number":37,"title":"...","state":"Shaping","url":"...","canonical_state":"Backlog"}
```

`state` is the remote option name as-is; `canonical_state` is reverse-mapped from the item's option id against the env-pinned canonical option IDs (`null` when the option id is unknown locally), so a legacy remote display name still reports which canonical state the item is in. `item-state` never mutates anything.

Then decide:

- the item already carries the intended state (idempotent outcome) — nothing to do
- the item sits in a different state than expected — re-run `set-status` with the verified target, or `next-status` with the ACTUAL current state as CURRENT
- the board is unreachable — transient read failures exit 3 and are safe to retry later

### Exit Codes

The helper's shared exit contract:

- `0` — success, including a verified idempotent no-op (a status command finding the item already in the requested state, or a sync finding nothing pending)
- `1` — hard failure: usage/config errors, unresolvable Workflow State name or option, no board item for the issue, ambiguous duplicate board items, a failed `next-status` precondition, a post-edit verification mismatch, a `list-statuses` result with zero statuses, release-tag/title validation failures
- `3` — retryable or deferred: exhausted board-read retries (rate limit, network — safe to retry later) and the dual-record offline deferral (the local record write is kept and marked `pending_sync: true`)
- any other non-zero code — gh's own failure propagating for a non-transient read failure; reads are never retried for these, and mutations are never retried at all

### Complete Issue

Use both collaboration surfaces when appropriate:

1. move the project item to `Done`
2. close the issue
3. optionally add a completion comment (final outcome only)

Typical sequence:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" set-status ISSUE_NUMBER "Done"
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" issue-close ISSUE_NUMBER --comment "Completed and validated."
```

If the workflow requires board-state visibility, do not only close the issue. Also update the project status.

### Create PR When Issue Is Ready For Code Review

Use:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" pr-create "ISSUE-123: short task title" \
  --base master \
  --head BRANCH_NAME \
  --body-file /tmp/pr.md
```

The first positional is the required title; every other flag passes straight through to the underlying PR-create command. The helper resolves the repository from `.github-project.env` (`ANT_TEAM_GITHUB_REPO`); a pass-through `--repo` flag cannot override it. Prefer `--body-file` so the PR includes task link, summary, verification, and review notes.

Related PR operations:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" pr-list --state open
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" pr-view PR_NUMBER
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" pr-close PR_NUMBER
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" pr-merge PR_NUMBER
```

`pr-view` and `pr-list` print curated collaboration JSON by default; pass `--json`, `--jq`, `--template`, `--comments`, or `--web` to control the output shape yourself. `pr-create` prints the curated `{"number", "title", "state", "url"}` result from the creation response; `pr-close` and `pr-merge` mutate, re-read, and print the same four-field contract carrying the post-mutation state. `pr-merge` and `pr-close` are policy-controlled: caller flags pass through only; approval gates are never bypassed.

### Comment On A PR

Use:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" pr-comment PR_NUMBER --body "MESSAGE"
```

Use this for review handoffs, retest notes, or high-level review conversation. PR comments carry final decisions, status, closure, and code-review results; durable handoffs and reasoning live in the central Obsidian project folder.

### Reply To A PR Review Comment

Prefer the review-comment reply command when the user specifically wants to reply in-thread to an existing review comment.

Use:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" pr-review-reply COMMENT_ID "Reply message"
```

The helper posts the reply through a fixed, parameterized GraphQL mutation: user input travels only as GraphQL variables, never inside the query text. Discovering an inline review-comment node ID has no helper subcommand yet — when you need one, fall back to raw `gh api` against the pull-request review-comments endpoint for that discovery step only, or take the comment node ID from the review thread itself.

If the user only needs a general PR response and not an in-thread reply, `pr-comment` is simpler.

### Inspect PR Checks And CI Workflow Runs

Use:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" pr-checks PR_NUMBER
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" run-list --limit 10
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" run-view RUN_ID
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" workflow-list
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" workflow-run WORKFLOW_ID_OR_NAME --ref BRANCH_NAME
```

- `pr-checks` curates the tabular checks output into JSON (the underlying command has no `--json` flag) and propagates its exit status: any failing or pending check exits non-zero.
- `run-list`, `run-view`, and `workflow-list` print curated JSON by default; pass `--json`, `--jq`, `--template`, or `--web` to control the output shape yourself.
- `workflow-run` (dispatch) prints the curated dispatch summary `{"workflow", "repo", "status": "dispatched"}` — the dispatch response carries no run id, so no run read is invented; follow up with `run-list` / `run-view` for the run. It is policy-controlled: caller flags pass through only and never bypass approval gates. The helper never executes workflows' tests locally and performs no Git operations.

### Manage Releases

Use:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" release-create v1.2.3 \
  --title "v1.2.3" \
  --notes-file /tmp/release-notes.md
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" release-list
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" release-view v1.2.3
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" release-edit v1.2.3 --notes-file /tmp/release-notes.md
```

`release-view` and `release-list` print curated JSON by default; pass `--json`, `--jq`, `--template`, or `--web` to control the output shape yourself. `release-create` and `release-edit` mutate, then re-read the release and print the same curated shape as `release-view` (the mutation response is only a URL). `release-delete` prints `{"tagName", "url", "deleted": true}`. All three validate the tag against the canonical Git tag rules before the underlying release command runs. `release-delete` is policy-controlled and destructive: caller flags pass through only and the `--yes` auto-confirm is never injected.

### Reconcile Local Records With GitHub (Dual-Record Sync)

The mutating issue and milestone CRUD commands (`issue-create`, `issue-edit`, `issue-close`, `milestone-create`, `milestone-edit`, `milestone-close`) are local-first: they write the local Obsidian record under `ANT_TEAM_DOCS_PROJECT_PATH/issue/` or `.../spec/` FIRST, then synchronize it to GitHub when online. Mapping is deterministic: issue number → `issue/ISSUE-0NN-*.md` (frontmatter `github_number`); milestone number → `spec/SPEC-0NN-*.md` (frontmatter `github_milestone`). The "Local Notes" section and local-only frontmatter are always preserved.

Canonical-source rule:

- `templates/opencode/` is the canonical implementation source (helper behavior, command contracts, agent-facing guidance); generated mirrors are never hand-edited.
- Local Obsidian records are the local-first working source, authoritative for durable content (title, body, "Local Notes", local-only frontmatter). They are never regenerated from GitHub.
- GitHub is the online execution board/state, authoritative for execution-state fields (Workflow State, closure, assignees, labels, milestone link) when connected.

Offline or on GitHub failure, the local write is kept and marked `pending_sync: true`; the command exits `3` and names the recovery command on stderr. The local write is never rolled back. Recover and converge with:

```bash
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" issue-sync ISSUE_NUMBER
"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh" milestone-sync MILESTONE_NUMBER
```

Both are idempotent: pending local durable content (title, body) is pushed, GitHub execution-state fields (state/closure, labels, assignees, milestone link, URL) are pulled. On conflict (both sides changed since the last sync), durable content resolves toward the local record, execution-state toward GitHub, and unresolved conflicts are reported on stderr.

Read commands fall back to the local record when GitHub is unreachable and never write it; `issue-comment` and board commands stay GitHub-only. Local record writes are atomic (temp file + rename), slugified, and confined to `ANT_TEAM_DOCS_PROJECT_PATH/{issue,spec}/`; the helper never runs Git commit or push on the vault.

## GitHub Projects Notes

Assume GitHub Projects v2 unless the repository clearly uses something else.

For Projects v2:

- field names are not enough for mutation
- single-select values usually need option IDs
- item updates often require `gh api graphql`
- board reads go through the helper's query subcommands (`list-items`, `list-unassigned`, `item-id`, `item-state`, `item-get`, `list-statuses`, `project-list`, `project-view`, `project-field-list`) — they already join assignees and Workflow State option ids where the flattened CLI payloads cannot

If the CLI subcommand does not support the exact mutation needed, use `gh api graphql` rather than inventing a brittle workaround.

## Output Style

When answering the user, prefer:

- the exact command to run
- a one-line explanation of why that command is the right one
- a short note on what to verify next

When the workflow takes multiple commands, present them as a small sequence with the dependency between steps made explicit.

## Safety And Collaboration Rules

- Avoid bulk edits without previewing targets first.
- Avoid hard-coding IDs that were not freshly discovered.
- Avoid acting on the wrong owner or repo because of local defaults.
- Prefer individual Obsidian communication event files for agent handoffs, blockers, and reasoning. Use GitHub comments for final closing messages, status-critical updates, and links to the Obsidian event.
- If a mutation could affect many items, summarize the intended scope before executing.

## Reference File

Read [references/command-patterns.md](./references/command-patterns.md) whenever you need ready-to-adapt `gh` + `jq` recipes for:

- issue lookup and triage
- issue comments
- issue creation, editing, and closure
- milestone creation, listing, editing, and closure
- project listing and schema inspection
- project item add
- project item queries
- workflow-state filtering
- status option lookup
- GraphQL mutation templates
- PR lifecycle (create, view, list, comment, close, merge, checks) and review replies
- CI workflow-run inspection and dispatch
- release operations
- dual-record sync and offline recovery
- reporting filters

Use [scripts/gh_project_helper.sh](./scripts/gh_project_helper.sh) (the bundled engine; `"$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/gh_project_helper.sh"` is its thin centralized wrapper) whenever the user asks for repeated GitHub Project, issue, or milestone operations and the goal is to minimize prompt tokens, avoid repeating raw GraphQL mutations, and keep the repository resolved from `.github-project.env`.

If the repository is being bootstrapped, recommend creating `.github-project.env` during project initialization so future GitHub issue and project workflows work with minimal prompt overhead.

## Examples

**Example 1**

Input: "what `gh` command should I use to list open issues in this repo with the `blocked` label and show assignee + milestone?"

Output shape:

- the helper command `gh_project_helper.sh issue-list --label blocked` (curated JSON: number, title, state, assignees, labels, milestone, url)
- a `jq` filter if a tighter shape is needed
- a short explanation of the selected fields

**Example 2**

Input: "move issue 42 to In Review on our GitHub project board"

Output shape:

- commands to discover project, item, field, and option IDs
- the mutation command
- the verification command

**Example 3**

Input: "show me what work is on the project board but has no assignee"

Output shape:

- the helper command `gh_project_helper.sh list-unassigned` (curated JSON: item_id, issue_number, title, state, assignees, url — issue-linked board items with zero assignees)
- a `jq` filter if a tighter shape is needed
- concise summary of results
