Notes:
  - all board operations target the canonical "Workflow State" project field
  - board item queries (list-items, list-unassigned, item-id, item-state,
    item-get) and every set-status item lookup/verification run ONE shared
    GraphQL project-items engine: gh project item-list is limit-bounded and
    returns neither assignees nor option ids, so the engine never depends on
    it. Reads are pagination-safe: items are paged with first:100 cursor pages
    (bounded at 10 pages / 1000 items; truncation beyond the bound is
    warned on stderr, never silent). list-items/list-unassigned print
    {item_id, issue_number, title, state, assignees, url} per issue-linked
    item with REAL assignees; "state" is the REMOTE Workflow State option
    name preserved/displayed as-is (never translated to the canonical
    name). An optional state argument filters by canonical state resolved
    to its option id via the same resolver as set-status (name-agnostic:
    correct even when the remote display name is a legacy rename); an
    unknown state fails non-zero with guidance before any query results
    are printed. item-id prints {item_id, issue_number, title, url, state};
    item-id and item-state fail non-zero naming the issue when it has no
    board item, and item resolution by issue number is ambiguity-safe:
    multiple board items for one issue (duplicate board adds) fail
    non-zero naming every duplicate item id instead of acting on an
    arbitrary one
  - item-get <project_item_id> is the single-node verification read: it
    fetches ONE board item directly by its project item id (node(id:)
    GraphQL query, no board-wide paging) and prints the same recovery
    contract as item-state
    {item_id, issue_number, title, state, url, canonical_state}. Use it
    when you already hold the item id (list-items output, gh-item-edit
    follow-up). It fails non-zero naming the item id when the node does
    not exist or is not an issue-linked board item
  - item-state <issue_number> is the read-only recovery command: it prints
    {item_id, issue_number, title, state, url, canonical_state} where
    canonical_state is reverse-mapped from the item's option id against
    the env-pinned canonical option IDs (null when the option id is
    unknown locally). Run it after any failed or interrupted status
    mutation to see where the item actually sits; it never mutates
  - list-statuses resolves env-first: canonical Workflow State option IDs
    pinned in .github-project.env are printed by canonical name with NO
    remote call (canonical states without an env pin are noted on
    stderr); only when nothing is pinned does it fall back to remote
    field-list discovery by exact field name. A result that still
    resolves to zero statuses (no env pins and no remote Workflow State
    field/options) is a LOUD non-zero failure with guidance — never a
    silent empty success
  - verified + idempotent status mutations: set-status, set-status-id, and
    next-status find the item by issue number through the shared engine,
    skip the mutation when the item already carries the requested OPTION
    id (no duplicate edit, stderr notes the skip), perform exactly one
    item-edit attempt, then re-read the item and verify by option id —
    independent of the remote display name. A post-edit mismatch exits
    non-zero with the actual board state on stderr. next-status
    ISSUE_NUMBER CURRENT NEXT additionally enforces a precondition: the
    item must currently sit in CURRENT (matched by option id) or the
    command fails non-zero without mutating
  - bounded read-only retry: board read calls (the shared items engine,
    Workflow State field/option id discovery, project id discovery, and
    list-statuses) retry transient failures (rate limit, network) up to 3
    attempts with a short pause, then exit 3 — safe to retry later.
    Mutations are NEVER retried: a failed mutation fails immediately.
    Exit 3 is the shared "retryable" exit (also used by the dual-record
    offline deferral below); hard usage/config errors stay exit 1
  - project-list, project-view, and project-field-list are thin
    gh project list/view/field-list wrappers plus curated jq output; they
    never use the GraphQL items engine (field-list already returns
    single-select options). The owner resolves --owner flag ->
    ANT_TEAM_GITHUB_OWNER env -> legacy OWNER and must be non-empty (the
    underlying list command without an owner silently targets the
    authenticated user — a cross-owner footgun); the owner is never a
    positional argument. PROJECT_NUMBER is a required positional validated
    numeric, and --format accepts only json — both checked before gh runs
  - curated board output contract: set-status, set-status-id, list-items, and
    item-id print curated JSON objects that always carry issue_number, title,
    state, and url (list-items also reports assignees; item-id also reports
    item_id). set-status / set-status-id re-read the board item AFTER the
    edit and verify by option id, so the printed state is the post-edit
    verification value and an edit that silently failed cannot report a
    stale state
  - curated mutator output contract: every mutator except issue-comment and
    pr-comment returns useful structured JSON, never raw gh output.
    issue-create and pr-create print {number, title, state, url}, reusing
    the mutation's URL response plus the caller's title and the
    deterministic OPEN state (no extra read). issue-edit, issue-close,
    pr-close, and pr-merge re-read the object AFTER the mutation and print
    {number, title, state, url} — the re-read IS the verification.
    release-create and release-edit re-read the release and print the same
    curated shape as release-view. release-delete prints {tagName, url,
    deleted: true} (a deleted release cannot be re-read; mutation success
    is the verification). workflow-run prints {workflow, repo,
    status: "dispatched"} (the dispatch response carries no run id; use
    run-list / run-view for run summaries). issue-comment and pr-comment
    keep their URL permalink output: the permalink IS the useful result
  - canonical state model: Open -> Backlog -> Ready -> In Progress -> In Review
    -> Ready to Merge -> Done; exceptions: Need attentions (founder-only) and
    Blocked
  - runtime config resolution: .github-project.env (ANT_TEAM_* exports) is
    the sole project config source; it is seeded and updated by
    init-project ("$ANT_TEAM_SCRIPTS/init-project.sh" after
    scripts/init-company.sh). Legacy unprefixed env names (OWNER,
    PROJECT_NUMBER, ...) are a last-resort fallback
  - option IDs are resolved from the env config first, then from the remote
    board by exact option name
  - this helper never mutates remote board option names; renaming a remote
    option (e.g. legacy "Inbox" -> "Open", "Shaping" -> "Backlog") requires
    explicit founder-approved handling. After such a rename, update the
    .github-project.env option IDs with the verified remote IDs
  - issue-* wrap gh issue and milestone-* wrap the REST milestones API via
    gh api. The target repository always resolves from
    .github-project.env (ANT_TEAM_GITHUB_REPO, legacy REPO fallback) and
    is never a positional argument; a pass-through --repo flag cannot
    override it
  - pr-* wrap gh pr with the same env-only repo contract as issue-*;
    pr-view and pr-list print curated JSON by default, and pr-checks
    curates gh's tabular checks output into JSON (gh pr checks has no
    --json). Pass --json, --jq, --template, --comments, or --web to
    control the output shape yourself
  - pr-merge and pr-close are policy-controlled: they pass caller flags
    through only and never inject --admin or bypass approval gates
  - pr-review-reply posts an in-thread reply to a PR review comment via a
    fixed parameterized GraphQL mutation; user input travels only as
    GraphQL variables, never inside the query text
  - run-* and workflow-* wrap gh run / gh workflow with the same env-only
    repo contract as issue-*; run-list, run-view, and workflow-list print
    curated JSON by default (pass --json, --jq, --template, or --web to
    control the output shape yourself). This helper never executes
    workflows' tests locally and performs no Git operations
  - workflow-run (dispatch) is policy-controlled: it passes caller flags
    through only and never injects --admin or bypasses approval gates
  - release-* wrap gh release with the same env-only repo contract as
    issue-*; release-view and release-list print curated JSON by default
    (pass --json, --jq, --template, or --web to control the output shape
    yourself)
  - release-create, release-edit, and release-delete validate the tag
    against the canonical Git tag rules and fail before invoking gh;
    release-delete is policy-controlled and destructive: it passes caller
    flags through only, never injects --admin, never defaults the --yes
    auto-confirm, and never bypasses approval gates
  - extra flags after the required positional argument pass straight
    through to gh issue / gh api; issue-view and issue-list print curated
    JSON by default (pass --json, --jq, --template, --comments, or --web
    to control the output shape yourself)
  - issue-comment exists for final decisions, status, closure, and
    code-review outcomes only; durable handoffs live in the central
    Obsidian project folder
  - local-first dual-record sync: mutating issue/milestone CRUD commands
    (issue-create, issue-edit, issue-close, milestone-create,
    milestone-edit, milestone-close) write the local Obsidian record under
    ANT_TEAM_DOCS_PROJECT_PATH/issue/ or .../spec/ FIRST, then synchronize
    to GitHub when online. Mapping is deterministic: issue number ->
    issue/ISSUE-0NN-*.md by github_number frontmatter; milestone number ->
    spec/SPEC-0NN-*.md by github_milestone frontmatter. The "Local Notes"
    section and local-only frontmatter are always preserved
  - offline / GitHub failure: the local write is kept and marked
    pending_sync: true; the command exits 3 with a stderr warning naming
    the recovery command (issue-sync <n> / milestone-sync <n>); the local
    write is never rolled back
  - issue-sync <n> and milestone-sync <n> converge the local record and
    GitHub idempotently: pending local durable content (title, body) is
    pushed, GitHub execution-state fields (state/closure, labels,
    assignees, milestone link, URL) are pulled. On conflict (both sides
    changed since the last sync) durable content resolves toward the local
    record, execution-state toward GitHub, and resolved conflicts are
    reported on stderr
  - reads fall back to the local record when GitHub is unreachable and
    never write it; issue-comment and board commands stay GitHub-only
  - local record writes are atomic (temp file + rename), slugified, and
    confined to ANT_TEAM_DOCS_PROJECT_PATH/{issue,spec}/; the helper never
    runs git commit / git push on the vault and never edits
    .github-project.env
  - owner_type defaults to "org". Use "user" for personal projects.
  - Requires gh and jq.

# ONE shared engine backs list-items, list-unassigned, item-id, item-state,

# project item-list (gh 2.45) is limit-bounded and returns neither

# larger than the bound is listed partially with a stderr truncation
# warning).
#
# The page-1 query deliberately omits the cursor variable instead of
# relying on null-variable coercion: gh's -f/-F flags cannot express a
# JSON null portably, so follow-up pages use a query variant that declares

# the GraphQL items engine — field-list already returns single-select
# options, so no GraphQL is needed for metadata (guardrail). The owner is
# REQUIRED and never positional: it resolves --owner flag ->
# ANT_TEAM_GITHUB_OWNER env -> legacy OWNER, and an empty resolution fails
# BEFORE gh runs (the underlying list command without an owner silently
# targets the authenticated user's projects — a cross-owner footgun).
# PROJECT_NUMBER is a required positional validated numeric before gh, and
